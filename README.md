# My impulse buy half off cromebook came with a surprise

A laptop you can keep in the trunk but just as good after some hacks. AFTER I bought it, I learned google wants to keep its operating system on the chromebook, use their cloud etc but we already have our own cloud. I had to dissemble a few things to over ride a write protect on firmware which google set up. I figured it out and wiped the chrome OS then installed ubuntu, we then linked it with an open source cloud on our raspberry pi and this 200$ computer now does the same stuff as any new computer now.
